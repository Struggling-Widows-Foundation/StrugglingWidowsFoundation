                                I am Rahel, I  lost my husband 25years ago. Being just a housewife,
                                things were not  the best on my part especially in bringing up the children.
                                Its was more of nightmare situation. We were barely surviving since the load
                                on me was so heavy, no one to really support me especially with the children.
                                Farming was the main activity to support us and as God will always have  it.
                                I was  able to sponsor some of the children through out their elementary school.
                                It was  a journey of good , bad and  ugly moments.
                                Thank God for Joan (of blessed memory) who introduced me to SWF (my second husband).
                                I pray God will keep replenishing the source of this foundation. And for you Joan,
                                may your soul continue to rest in peace till we meet one day to part no more.

                            <p>
                                My name is Helen. I was 4months pregnant 9years ago when I lost
                                the source of my bone. Life for me wasn't worth living.
                                I knew I was going to die. it was for my sake that  he went
                                fetching  water that night  and was bitten by a snake. Things became
                                tough  for my  unborn child and I. Just few days after the burial,
                                my husband family didn't allow me to mourn him  for a week,
                                they accused me of killing their brother. As a result, I was kicked out
                                of the house, all the pigs, goats my husband kept were confiscated by them.
                                Me and my unborn were left with nothing, I went back to my brother’s
                                house who was a catechist . It was really rough on me, I kept imagining
                                how servants were riding on houses and kings were trekking, my husband
                                family was reaping what my husband sowed while I was barely surviving in
                                my brother’s house, what kept me going was the word of wisdom my brother told me”
                                Helen! When your cloud is full, your rain will fall” behold my rain fell  one
                                faithful Thursday. On my way from  the farm, I met  a group of ladies discussing
                                about SWF. It caught my attention, I joined them,  weeks later, I joined SWF, and
                                since then this foundation has been  of great help to me morally, physically,
                                spiritually and financially. My prayer is; this foundation should  move from
                                strength to strength as it helps with the plight of these vulnerable widows like me.
